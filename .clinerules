# Clinerules for Modern React Application Development

This document outlines the current best practices and rules for developing React applications, focusing on performance, maintainability, and modern development patterns.

## 1. Code Performance

### 1.1 Component Optimization

* **Code Splitting:** Use React.lazy() and Suspense for component-level code splitting to reduce initial bundle size.
* **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images and heavy components that are not immediately needed.
* **Memoization:** Use React.memo() strategically for expensive components that receive stable props.
* **Render Optimization:** Implement debouncing and throttling for expensive operations or frequent updates.
* **Bundle Optimization:** Use dynamic imports for routes and large dependencies that aren't needed immediately.

### 1.2 State Management

* **Local State:** Use useState for simple component-level state.
* **Complex State:** Use modern state management solutions:
  - Zustand for simple global state
  - Jotai for atomic state management
  - TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
* **State Colocation:** Keep state as close as possible to where it's used.
* **Immutable Updates:** Always use immutable state updates to ensure proper rendering.
* **Computed State:** Cache computed values using useMemo when dealing with expensive calculations.

### 1.3 Rendering Optimization

* **Stable References:** Use useCallback for function props passed to memoized components.
* **Event Handlers:** Define event handlers outside render when possible.
* **List Rendering:** Always use stable, unique keys for list items.
* **Batch Updates:** Utilize React's automatic batching for state updates.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Use React DevTools Profiler to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

## 2. Code Maintainability

### 2.1 Component Architecture

* **Composition:** Use component composition over inheritance.
* **Custom Hooks:** Extract reusable logic into custom hooks.
* **Feature-First Structure:** Organize code by features rather than technical concerns:
```
src/
  features/
    auth/
      components/
      hooks/
      utils/
      types/
    dashboard/
    settings/
  shared/
    components/
    hooks/
    utils/
```
* **Component Size:** Keep components focused and manageable (under 250 lines).

### 2.2 Modern Development Practices

### 2.3 Testing Best Practices

* **Component Testing:**
  - Use @testing-library/react
  - Test component behavior, not implementation
  - Write tests from user perspective
* **Hook Testing:**
  - Use @testing-library/react-hooks
  - Test custom hooks in isolationUI components

## 3. Build and Development Tools

### 3.1 Modern Tooling


### 3.2 Code Quality Tools

* **ESLint Configuration:**
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "react-app",
    "react-app/jest",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"
  }
}
```
* **Prettier:** Enforce consistent code formatting
* **Git Hooks:** Use husky for pre-commit checks:
  - Lint staged files
  - Run relevant tests
  - Check TypeScript types

## 4. API Integration

### 4.1 Data Fetching

* **API Client:** Use TanStack Query for data fetching:
  - Automatic caching
  - Background updates
  - Optimistic updates
  - Error handling
* **Error Handling:**
  - Implement error boundaries
  - Provide fallback UI components
  - Log errors to monitoring service

## 5. Accessibility

* **Components:**
  - Use semantic HTML elements
  - Implement proper ARIA attributes
  - Ensure keyboard navigation
* **Focus Management:**
  - Maintain focus order
  - Trap focus in modals
  - Provide skip links
* **Testing:**
  - Use jest-axe for automated checks
  - Test with screen readers
  - Verify color contrast


## 6. Changelog Management

### 6.1 Changelog File

* Maintain a `changelog.md` file in the root directory of the project to track all significant changes.

### 6.2 Changelog Updates

* **Rule:** After any accepted code change (e.g., using `replace_in_file` or `write_to_file`), automatically update the `changelog.md` file.
* **Format:** Use a consistent format for changelog entries (e.g., date, version, description of changes).
* **Content:** Include a brief description of the changes, the affected files, and the reason for the change.

### 6.3 Changelog Reading

* **Rule:** The application should include a mechanism to read and display the contents of the `changelog.md` file, providing historical context for the project. This could be a dedicated page or a section within the application.
